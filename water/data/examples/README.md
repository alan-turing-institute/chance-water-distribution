# Kentucky Water Distribution Networks

This directory contains a set of example water networks with pollution scenarios produced by simulation with [WNTR](https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR).

The example networks are taken from the [Water Distribution System Research Database](http://www.uky.edu/WDST/database.html) and use the same naming convention.
