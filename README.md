Water Distribution Network Web App
----

Task is to develop a web app that can load a water distribution network and simulate the spread of contamination/pollution through the network over time.

The purpose of the app is engagement and the information displayed should satisfy stakeholders including:

- Water operators
- Pollution sensor companies
- The national infrastructure commission

It should strike a balance between providing some useful information about contamination and maximising engagement through looking nice!

### Data

The data for contamination spread scenarios is pre-computed and coupled with information on (water) demand for network nodes (reservoirs, tanks and junctions), as well as diameter and lengths of the edges (pipes).

### Primary features

1. Visual representation of the water network(s)
2. Animation of contamination spread through the network with visual cues for things like water demand and contamination concentration as they change in the nodes and edges
3. Ability to trigger a contamination spread via clicking a given node

### Secondary features

1. Visualization of Weisi/Alessio's Neural Network's decision making process for reducing a water network to a set of critical nodes
2. A version of the app that water networks can input their own water networks and contamination scenario data to, by uploading files in a format specified by the app

Run the App Locally
-------

*Tested with Python 3.6 and 3.7*

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/chance-water-distribution`
2. Install the python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download data modules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. Run flask server from top dir of the repo: `python water/main.py`

Deploying the App
-------

When deploying the app Flask's built in server should not be used. Suggestions
for WSGI servers that can be used with Flask can be found
[here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/deploying/). For example,
gunicorn can be used by
```
pip install gunicorn
cd water
gunicorn -w 4 main:app
```
