Water Distribution Network Web App
----

Task is to develop a web app that can load a water distribution network and simulate the spread of contamination/pollution through the network over time.

The purpose of the app is engagement and the information displayed should satisfy stakeholders including:

- Water operators
- Pollution sensor companies
- The national infrastructure commission

It should strike a balance between providing some useful information about contamination and maximising engagement through looking nice!

### Data

The data for contamination spread scenarios is pre-computed and coupled with information on (water) demand for network nodes (reservoirs, tanks and junctions), as well as diameter and lengths of the edges (pipes).

### Primary features

1. Visual representation of the water network(s)
2. Animation of contamination spread through the network with visual cues for things like water demand and contamination concentration as they change in the nodes and edges
3. Ability to trigger a contamination spread via clicking a given node

### Secondary features

1. Visualization of Weisi/Alessio's Neural Network's decision making process for reducing a water network to a set of critical nodes
2. A version of the app that water networks can input their own water networks and contamination scenario data to, by uploading files in a format specified by the app

Bokeh App
-------

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements in `requirements.txt`
3. Run bokeh server from top dir of the repo with `bokeh serve --show water`
